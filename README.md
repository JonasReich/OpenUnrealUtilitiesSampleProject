# Open Unreal Utilities Sample Project

This is a sample project for the Open Unreal Utilities plugin for Unreal Engine 4.
Please check the [plugin folder itself](Plugins/OpenUnrealUtilities) for a more detailed documentation of the plugin itself.
The plugin source code is [hosted separately on github](https://github.com/JonasReich/OpenUnrealUtilities). 

This repository contains a full copy of the plugin embedded as git subrepo.
Therefore if you want to make extensions to the plugin and don't need the full verison history, you can clone this repository instead of the
main plugin repo to ensure the plugin can be built without any other project dependencies.

Please check the [git subrepo documentation](https://github.com/ingydotnet/git-subrepo) for more info on how to pull and push updates from/to the plugin repo.
